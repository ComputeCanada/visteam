These visualizations show examples of photorealistic rendering with ParaView and OSPRay. OSPRay is a fast, open-source
ray tracing library from Intel capable of visualizing both surfaces and volumes. It provides ambient occlusion, shading
and the ability to work with realistic materials. You can define your own materials too. For more details, please watch
the
["Photorealistic rendering with ParaView and OSPRay" webinar](https://westgrid.github.io/trainingMaterials/tools/visualization/#photorealistic-rendering-with-paraview-and-ospray)
recorded in January 2020.

The two clips below show a mixture of surface materials:
