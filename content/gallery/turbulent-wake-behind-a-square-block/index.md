<!-- https://www.computecanada.ca/visualization/turbulent-wake-behind-a-square-block -->

This simulation and visualization by Zixiang Chen and Robert Martinuzzi (University of Calgary) shows the vorticity
magnitude of the turbulent wake behind a square block mounted on a flat surface. The Reynolds number based on the width
of the obstacle is of the order of 1e4. The visualization was done as a volume rendering in ParaView, and the original
simulation was run with OpenFOAM.
