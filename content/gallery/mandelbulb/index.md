This visualization shows a power-8 [Mandelbulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb), discretized at
1600^3 (32MB compressed NetCDF file) and rendered with ParaView. This dataset is part of our ParaView
workshop where attendees try to recreate this picture with parallel (4--8 CPU cores) remote rendering on our
training cluster. This visualization featuring ambient occlusion and custom lights was created by
[Alex Razoumov](mailto:alexeir@sfu.ca) (SFU).
