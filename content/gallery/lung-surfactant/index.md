This animation by Svetlana Baoukina, Dmitri Rozmanov and Peter Tieleman (University of Calgary) shows a lipid monolayer
in equilibrium with lipid vesicles on water surface. The lipids in vesicles and monolayers are separated into the
liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases (domains). The vesicles are formed in water (not shown) as a result of
monolayer collapse caused by external compression. This large-scale complex structure is a 3D molecular dynamics model
of lung surfactant, computed with the coarse-grained Martini model using GROMACS software. The movie was generated using
ParaView. Simulations were performed on WestGrid (Compute Canada) resources.
