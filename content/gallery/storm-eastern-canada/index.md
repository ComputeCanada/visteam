This visualization shows output from a numerical simulation of a storm over Eastern Canada during Halloween
2019 from the research group of {{<a "https://alejandro-diluca.uqam.ca" "Alejandro Di Luca">}} (Université du
Québec à Montréal). The animation below covers six days from October 31st to November 5th, 2019. The 3D volume
features the distribution of clouds (white), rain (green to cyan), and ice crystals (yellow) in the
atmosphere, whereas the 2D surface at the bottom shows the snow accumulation on the ground. The 3D variables
are also displayed in the two projections, along the x- and y-axes, to highlight the vertical distribution of
the three variables.
