In 2013 we worked with Alena Antipova and Colin Denniston from the Department of Applied Mathematics at Western
University to visualize a numerical simulation of the motion of a nickel nanodisk suspended in nematic liquid crystal
under the action of a weak magnetic field. Below are the snapshots from a movie showing the nickel disk particles,
liquid crystal particle orientation and a topological defect in orange. The particles were imported in one of the VTK
formats, the 3D fields in NetCDF, and scripting of time evolution and cut plane animation was done with Python inside
ParaView.
