This animation by David Williamson, Hugo Martel and Daisuke Kawata shows a single frame of a dwarf galaxy simulated with
the SPH code GCD+ (written by Daisuke Kawata). The visualization was generated by calculating the column density of the
gas through the simulation volume in a given direction using the SPH smoothing kernel and then plotting the resulting 2D
image. This projected view reveals the shape and structure of low-density bubbles. These are less visible in a simple
scatter plot of particle densities.
