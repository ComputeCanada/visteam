These models and visualizations were developed by Kevin Ryczko and Isaac Tamblyn (UOIT).

The platinum-water interface is of great interest in the field of electrochemistry. Platinum is known to be one of the
most efficient metals for water electrolysis due to its low over potential. These molecular dynamics models use the
Vienna ab Initio Simulation Package to investigate the structural properties of water next to platinum. The supercell
consists of 112 platinum atoms and 100 water molecules. The image above was generated using VMD, and then was rendered
in 8K using POVRAY, which took about 45 minutes. In the image, the silver atoms are the Platinum atoms, the red and
while molecules are water molecules, and the smaller grey atoms in the background are periodic images of the supercell.

The following movie of the platinum-water interface was rendered in VMD using a TCL script.
