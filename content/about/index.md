Using the Alliance's[^1] resources and technical expert help, you can easily convert the results of your numerical
simulations or your experimental data into engaging images or movies to share with colleagues, to put online, or into a
publication. Our technical staff have extensive experience in scientific visualization and visual data analysis,
primarily using open-source tools such as ParaView, VisIt, VTK, Blender, VMD, and various Python libraries to work with
a wide variety of data types. Large multi-dimensional datasets can be visualized directly on HPC clusters without having
to move them to your desktop. We can help you with all stages of visualization, from preparing data in the right format
to interactive analysis.
